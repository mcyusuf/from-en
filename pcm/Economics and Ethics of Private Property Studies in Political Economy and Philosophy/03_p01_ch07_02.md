Selgin and White’s nor gree recognise dis one, and dia belief for de ethical innocence of fractional reserve banking, na cos of two confusions. For one hand, as dem don already indicate, dem nor recognise say no object—and different person nor fit get any amount of money (gold)— for de same time and no contract fit increase de numba of de property wey dey ground, and cos of dat, any oda claim na fraud. For anoda hand, and intimately related, Selgin and White nor recognize de fundamental praxeological difference wey dey between property and property titles. But, for subsuming money (gold) and money substitutes (banknotes) unda de same heading of “money” dem continue to dey confuse dis difference so dem go hide de truth. Cos if dem define money (gold) and titles to money (banknotes) as “money,” then e nor show any difference  whether de supply of money abi dat of banknotes dey increase. Both of dem na “money” so, by definition, for both cases of de same event— increase for de supply of money—don take place be dat. But dis one nor change de mata say; e only comot dem from existence.

Of course, as Selgin and White don correctly show, everyone dey free to use any definition and even make any  distinction wey dem want. But upon dat definitions nor dey create real distinctions; But dem fit make dem disappear sha. De only tin wey dem fit do na to reflect de distinctions abi make dem ignore and confuse dem; and if we refer to both to both money and money substitutes indiscriminately as money na to hide the difference wey dey between two categorically—praxeologically—distinct phenomena and states of affairs. Tiitle for money and increase for titles nor be de same tin as money and increase of money. But, unlike increase for de quantity of money (gold) abi increase for titles wey dey backed by anoda increase of money, any increase for de quantity of titles to money wey no dey accompanied with another increased quantity of money necessarily mean say na more dan one person get de same quantity of money at de same time; and since dat kin tin nor dey possible—de quantity of money nor fit change and all na person must get all de money wey dey ground—every redemption of a fiduciary title, den, be it say e dey into money or abi any oda real property, involve act of illicit appropriation.

Assuming say both property and property titles (notes) exist. Apart from property wey dey consumer goods, producer goods, and money, titles to consumer goods, titles to producer goods, and titles to money dey assum say dem dey exist. De origin of property titles wit addition to de existence of property dey promotes legal certainty and e dey reduce and even facilitate legal disputes, so e undoubtedly represent beneficial (natural) development. E even allow two innovations self. For one hand, e dey possible make dem separate de act of transferring ownership in property from de act of transferring its possession. As in, e dey possible make dem surrender or acquire ownership for objects without simultaneously surrendering abi acquiring possession, disposition, and control of de same object. If we apply am to money e go dey possible say, all de while de ownership of de quantities of money (gold) wey dey ground before fit change constantly from one person to anoda, de entire quantity of money fit remain—unchangingly—for de hands of one and de same bank (since na him dey manage de  money of odas). For anoda hand, with de development of property titles, intertemporal exchanges go dey systematically facilitated. Dem fit transfer property wey dey ground abi dem fit transfer  titles  so that  dem fit use am exchange against titles to future property (debt claims); so we fit assume say next to titles to property wey dey exist before (consumer goods, producer goods, and money), titles (debt claims) to future consumer goods, future producer goods, together with future money dey exist and dem dey traded as well.

On top dese development, de following transactions (contracts) wey dey between any two parties A (bank client) and B (bank) dey possible. A fit transfer him money (gold) for B’s disposition and he fit (1) nor give up him ownership inside, abi (2) him fit give up him ownership. Anoda possibility no dey. If (1), den A keep de title for d sum of money wey he transfer to B; B nor get title to am, but he go dey act as person wey dey keep money (a bailee) for A (as a money bailor). Anoda possibility no dey. If (2), den B collect de title on top de quantity of money wey A keep for him hand; A go collect something from B in exchange either (a) consumer goods with/abi producer goods wey be say na B get am before; abi (b) consumer goods with/abi producer goods wey dey for B hand (but na A get am now) (an equity claim); abi (c) a title  for quantity of future consumer with/abi producer goods with/abi money (a debt claim). Again, anoda possibility nor dey. Dis one mean say, A nor fit retain ownership of dis property come transfer am to B.

Among all possible transactions, not one would result in the issue of a fiduciary note. Fiduciary media, according to Selgin and White’s own definition, are “that portion of redeemable money substitutes backed by assets other than base money.”[^10] There are money (gold) and money substitutes (titles to money) in existence, and there are titles to non-money goods (equity titles), and titles to not-yet-existing future goods (debt claims). Apparently, however, no such thing as “money substitutes backed by assets other than base money” would arise out of any of these transactions. Selgin and White *assume* the existence of fiduciary media (and they simply *assume* that the absence of fiduciary media must be the result of legal restrictions), but they do not provide a praxeological explanation and reconstruction of the origin of such a peculiar entity and state of affairs. Rather, they only ask, why not? “We do not see why bank and customer cannot contractually agree to make them [that is, demand deposits and banknotes] debts and not warehouse receipts.” *Why* is it that there can—and should—be no money substitutes backed by assets other than money? For the same reason that there can and should be no car or house titles backed by assets other than cars or houses, that there can and should be no equity titles backed by assets other than equity, and that there can and should be no assets—money, equity, or debt—owned (backed) by more than one person at a time. Titles to money suppose dey backed by money de same way and for de same reason as titles to cars suppose dey backed by cars. Dis na wetin dey define dem as property titles. E dey in accordance with and e dey reflect de nature of  de property and property titles. For anoda way, title to money wey dey backed by assets instead money na contradiction in terms, and im issue and use involve de same sort of objective misrepresentation with de issue of  title to mottor wey dey backed by assets instead of car (parts of planes and bikes, for example).[^11]

Inside all dese transactions wey dey possible, nor one go fit result for de issue of a fiduciary note. Fiduciary media, according to Selgin and White’s own definition, be “dat portion of redeemable money substitutes wey dey backed by assets instead of base money.”[^10] E get money (gold) and money substitutes (titles to money) wey dey for existence, and e get titles to non-money goods (equity titles), and titles to not-yet-existing future goods (debt claims). Apparently, however, nothing like “money substitutes wey dey backed by assets oda dan base money” fit comot from any of dese transactions. Selgin and White assume de existence of fiduciary media (and dem come agree say de absence of fiduciary media happen because of legal restrictions), but dem nor provide praxeological explanation wit reconstruction of de origin like de peculiar entity wit state of affairs. Instead, dey only ask, why not? “We nor de reason why bank and deir customer nor fit contractually agree so dat dem fit make them [as in, demand deposits wit banknotes] debts and nor be warehouse receipts.” Why be say e fit be—and fit be say— money substitutes no dey backed wit assets oda dan money? For de same reason wey be say car abi houses title fit dey backed or he fit nor dey backed by assets oda dan cars abi houses, say equity titles fit dey backed abi e fit nor dey backed with assets wey dey different from equity, and say more dan one person nor fit get assets—money, equity, abi debt (backed) at de same time. Titles to money are—and should be—backed by money in the same way and for the same reason as titles to cars are and should be backed by cars. This is what defines them as property titles. It is in accordance with and a reflection of the nature of property and property titles. In distinct contrast, a title to money backed by assets other than money is a contradiction in terms, and its issue and use involves the same sort of objective misrepresentation as the issue of a title to a car backed by assets other than a car (parts of planes and bikes, for instance).[^11]

De answer to de reason why fractional reserve agreements dey ethically impermissible, and contract nor fit dey to use make warehouse receipts debt, be say dat kin agreements and contracts contradict (deny) de way tins dey. Dat kind contract from de beginning na—priori—invalid. Selgin and White wan try to escape dis conclusion wey dey difficult to escape by adopting, with sense or without sense,  one ultra-subjectivist view of contracts with agreements. According to dis view, d fact say dem reach voluntary agreement with/or one contract dem wey dem don conclude show say e must dey valid—true or permissible—agreement togeda with contract. Nor be only lie be dis view, e still dey incompatible with Rothbard’s title-transfer theory of contract wey all dese authors claim say dem don  accept. Agreements and contracts per se nor mean anytin at all as e regard dia validity for de fundamental reason say agreements and contracts nor fit create reality, instead e presuppose am. Still self, contracts nor fit bring property into existence, instead na to recognize and transfer existing property. Hence, for inside Rothbard’s ethical system, de theory of property must cum before treatment of contracts. Contracts and contract theory presuppose dey constrained by property and property theory. As in, de range of possible (valid) contracts dey limited and e dey restricted by de existing quantity (stock) of property together with de nature of things, instead of de oda way around. Thus, agreements wey dey related to flying elephants, centaurs, squared circles, of perpetui mobile, for example, na invalid contract dem be. Dem nor fit—by virtue of biological, physical, abi mathematical law—dey fulfilled, and dem from beginning be lie and fraud.

As Selgin and White go acknowledge dis one, dem no recognize say fractional reserve banking agreement nor mean lesser impossibility and fraud pass de one wey dey involved for de trade of flying elephants or squared circles. In fact, de impossibility wey dey inside fractional reserve banking  big well well. For, so tey de impossibility of contracts wey dey related to flying elephants, for example, na merely contingent and empirical one (e no dey unbelievable say for anoda possible world, somewhere and sometime, flying elephants fit really exist, wey fit make  dat kin contract dey possible), de impossibility  wey dey fractional reserve banking contracts na necessary and categorical one. As in, e dey unbelievable —praxeologically impossible—say bank and dem customer fit agree say dem wan make money substitutes (banknotes, demand deposit accounts) debts instead of warehouse receipts. Dem fit talk abi make dem certify otherwise, of course, since anoda person fit talk say triangles na squares. But de tin wey dem talk go be correct lie. Since triangles go remain triangles and e go dey different from squares, so money substitutes go still be money substitutes (titles to present money) and e go dey different from debt claims (titles to not yet existing future goods) and equity claims (titles to existing property wey dey different from money). To yarn anoda tori nor go change de mata wey dey ground but e objectively misrepresent am.

If we wan do wetin Selgin and White believe say clients and banks don do—to agree say dem go make warehouse receipts debt—de money depositor A go collect from de bank B claim wey e go use present money, instead of debtor equity title. As in, A nor give up ownership of de money wey e deposit (as e go take be if had it been e collect debtor equity claim from B). As A hold de title to de money deposit, however, B nor treat A’s deposit as bailment, instead na as loan e treat am, and e enter am as asset inside him own (B’s) balance sheet (offset by an equal sum of outstanding demand liabilities). Dis one appear as if na harmless accounting practice, from de beginning e involve misrepresentation of de ogbonge state of affairs.[^12] Since both, B and A, count de same quantity of money simultaneously among  deir own assets, dey don already conspire say dem go represent demsef for deir financial accounts like say dem dey own big quantity of property pass wetin dem really get: as in, dem don turn to financial impostors.[^13] Even though dem dey fraudulent, dis one nor go matter if dem leave everytin as e take dey lik dat. However, immediately B do as if tins dey show de way e represent dem on top him balance sheet—as if na de bank get de money wey dem deposit and na only to redeem de outstanding warehouse receipts on demand na him dem fit-  misrepresentation don turn to misappropriation be dat. If B, according to him misrepresentation, borrow out money, or more likely, give additional warehouse receipts for money and cum borrow dese out to anoda person C, and dey expect say dem go pay am de principal with de interest back, de bank go bcum engaged inside illegal appropriation, bcos de tin wey e borrow C—whether na money abi titles to money— nor be him (B’s) own property but na anoda person (A) own. Na on top dis fact—say de title wey dem transferred from B to C concerns property B wey be say nor be him get am— and na dis makes fractional reserve banking from de beginning be fraud.

E nor be like dem claim, say dem commit fraud (breach of contract) only if B, de fractional reserve bank, nor fit fulfill all de requests for redemption as dem dey take come. Instead, B dey always commit fraud anytime e fulfill e redemption obligations. Bcos anytime B redeem e fractionally covered banknote into money (gold) (anytime wey note holder collect him property), na wit anoda person money dem dey do am: if B collect C’s note, na wit A money e go do am, and if A wan collect him money, B go pay am wit D money, and na lik dat e go continue. Qua defenders of fiduciary media togeda with fractional reserve banking, Selgin and White must maintain say no breach of contract dey as long as say  B dey fulfill him own contractual obligations wit anoda person property (money).

Yet this is patently wrong, and it stands in clear contradiction to Rothbard’s title transfer theory of contract that Selgin and White claim to have accepted. In accordance with Rothbard’s contract theory, individuals are only entitled to make contracts regarding the transfer of *their own property*. In contrast, fractional reserve banking, by its very nature (even if it is practiced successfully), involves contracts concerning the transfer of *other people’s property*. Hence this practice—the issue of fiduciary media—is in principle (inherently) incompatible with the title-transfer theory of contract—and it turns out, not surprisingly, that it is Rothbard, and not his two interpreters, who ultimately demonstrates a better grasp of his own contract theory.

[^11]: Similar logic-semantic confusions are at work when Selgin and White try to reduce the difference between demand and time liabilities to one of degree rather than kind (“In Defense of Fiduciary Media,” p. 90). Explains Selgin:

> Holders of demand liabilities are granters of credit just as are holders of time liabilities. The only difference is that in the former case the duration of individual loans is unspecified; they are “call loans” that may mature at any time;

and “Mises,” who holds the opposite view, “confuses a difference of degree with one of substance” (Selgin, *The Theory of Free Banking*, p. 62). In fact, it is Selgin who is confused.

To be sure, one might say that it is only a matter of degree whether a loan (of a car or of money) matures in an hour, a day, a week, or a month. Just as surely, however, this does not change the categorical distinction between present—existing—goods and not (yet) existing future goods. At any point in time, a car or a sum of money (gold) either exists or it does not exist. Nor does it alter the praxeological datum that no one, at any time, can act with anything except present goods. Future goods are the goal of actions, but in order to attain them, every actor must first invariably employ present means goods. Nor does Selgin’s observation concerning degrees of time affect in the slightest the fundamental human condition of scarcity. The supply of present goods is at all times limited, and the limited quantity of present goods limits in turn the quantity of possible future goods.

Whereas Mises recognizes the distinction between present goods and future goods as a universal praxeological category, Selgin’s attempt to conflate demand and time deposits (thus distinguish himself fundamentally from Mises) implies a denial that there is no such fundamental difference between present (existing) goods and future (not-existing) goods (or that their existence differs only in degrees). Contrary to Selgin, it is not a matter of degree but rather one of substance whether a car or a sum of money presently exists or not, and whether one person or someone else owns them. Either they exist or they don’t exist, and either A owns them or someone else does. Accordingly if a property title (demand deposit note) then states that one person is the owner of a present car or present money and no car or money exists, or the car or money is presently owned by someone else, this does not represent a degree of truth but a falsehood. Explains Mises:

> A depositor of a sum of money who acquires in exchange for it a claim convertible into money at any time which will perform exactly the same service for him as the sum it refers to has exchanged no present good for a future good. The claim that he has acquired by his deposit is also a present good for him. The depositing of money in no way means that he has renounced immediate disposal over the utility that it commands. (*The Theory of Money and Credit,* p. 268)

See also the two following notes.

[^12]: See on this point Rothbard. “How,” asks Rothbard,

> do these warehouse receipt transactions relate to the T-account balance sheets of the deposit banks? In simple justice, not at all. When I store a piece of furniture worth $5,000 in warehouse, in law and in justice the furniture does *not* show up as an asset of the warehouse during the time that I keep it there. The warehouse does not add $5,000 to both its assets and liabilities because it in no sense *owns* the furniture; neither can we say that I have *loaned* the warehouse the furniture for some indefinite time period. The furniture is mine and remains mine; I am only keeping it there for safekeeping and therefore I am legally and morally entitled to redeem it any time I please. I am not therefore the bank’s “creditor”; it doesn’t *owe* me money which I may some day collect. Hence, there is no debt to show up on the Equity + Liability side of the ledger. Legally, the entire transaction is not a loan but a *bailment*. (*The Mystery of Banking* [New York: Richardson and Snyder, 1983], pp. 88–89)

Interestingly, while Selgin and White manifest a strong positivistic tendency (fractional reserve banking is recognized by the courts, so it must be all right; on this tendency see “The Issue of Fraud III” below), they do not come to terms with legal reality. For if money deposits are debt, why, then, don’t the courts apply the same reasoning to all other fungible commodities such as wheat? Why are wheat warehouse receipts not considered a debt but a bailment by the courts? Why is this treatment peculiar to money and the banking business? Moreover, why is it that the courts, even if they falsely consider money deposits as debts, still insist that they are more than an ordinary debt, and the depositor’s relation to the bank is not identical with that of an ordinary creditor? See Rothbard, *Mystery of Banking*, p. 275.

[^13]: See also William Stanley Jevons (*Money and the Mechanism of Exchange* [London: Kegan Paul, 1905], pp. 206–12, 221), who lamented the existence of general deposits since it has “become possible to create a fictitious supply of a commodity, that is, to make people believe that a supply exists which does not exist.” On the other hand, special deposits, such as “bills of lading, pawn-tickets, dock-warrants, or certificates which establish ownership to a definite object,” are superior because “they cannot possibly be issued in excess of the good actually deposited, unless by distinct fraud.” And Jevons concluded that “it used to be held as a general rule of law, that a present grantor assignment of goods not in existence is without operation.”
